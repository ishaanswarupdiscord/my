              Galaxies are made up of stars, dust, and dark matter, all held
              together by gravity. It’s not scientifically proven how exactly
              galaxies were formed. After an explosion of matter, space was
              formed. It is made of hydrogen, helium and other particles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nature has provided an extremely large array of galaxies, ranging
              from faint, diffused to brilliant spiral-shaped giants. Galaxies
              usually exist in groups, some of which, in turn, are grouped into
              larger clusters.
            </p>
            <p>
              The galaxies were not recognized until the early 20<sup>th</sup>
              century. Since then, however, galaxies have become one of the very
              important points of astronomical study.

              Types of Galaxies
            </h2>
            <p>
              Galaxies are classified by shape. There are three general types:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Elliptical Galaxies: Elliptical galaxies have different sizes,
                ranging from tens of millions to over one hundred trillion
                stars.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spiral Galaxies: The Milky Way is a barred spiral, although the
                bar itself is difficult to observe from Earth's current position
                within the galactic disc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Irregular Galaxies: These galaxies have no perfect shape or
                structure. They have formed from collisions with other galaxies
                or frenzied internal activity.
              </li>
            </ul>

                Fun Facts about Galaxies

                  The greek word for "milky" is the origin of the word galaxy.

                  Most of the mass of a galaxy is made up of an unknown
                  substance called ‘dark matter’. Andromeda is the closest
                  galaxy to the Milky Way.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The sun needs two hundred million years to orbit the center of
                  the galaxy. This is called a galactic year.
                </li>
